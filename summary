A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit. In conclusion, I think there is an Ethical Quandary in that case. First of all, the type of data is matters. Only they know what kind of data that they are selling. And they don't even care about if it is harmful to the individual. If those data aren't anonymized, it might make that individual have no privateness.
Secondly, who is buying the data is also a big problem. The data recipient can do whatever to your information. They might sell to another company or group. They also can threaten the owner of the information in any field. So I think this behavior gets Ethical Quandary.
